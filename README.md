**All Challenge Writeups are password protected with the corresponding flag.**

~~All Machines writeups are protected with the corresponding root flag.~~ [https://www.hackthebox.eu/press/integrity-of-hack-the-box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/press/integrity-of-hack-the-box)

**All machine writeups are protected with the corresponding root user password hash, except for Obscurity, whose writeup is protected with the root user flag.**

- For **Linux** machines, the root user password hash is equivalent to the hash in the `/etc/shadow` file, for example:
  
  `root:`**\$6\$F5o3Sdoc$y.IdYyCK74kDS6zXxW7iFer8JdaagQAViaZJGO1Om8MPZUxn8XTml9TNLn2deLNRPNKwZAvHKfefAtnDVD5Zo/**`:14671:0:90:6:7:14800:9`
